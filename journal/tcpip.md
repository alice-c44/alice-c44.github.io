# The TCP/IP Model

This model has four total layers.

## Application

Protocols:
- For phone calls it uses VOIP (voice over IP)
- For text messages it uses SMS
- For websites it uses WWW 


## Transport

Transports your packets using either TCP or UDP.
TCP is slow but will make sure your packets get to it's destination as you sent it. UDP is instant but may lose some of your packets.

## Internet

Uses a router to direct your packet based on congestion or other factors. It also has your IP address so things can reach you.

## Link (Network Access)

Protocols in this layer include:

- Wifi
- Bluetooth
- LTE
- Ethernet
